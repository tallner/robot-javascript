# JAVA21-christian-tallner-html-slutprojekt  
This is the final project of the html and css class in JAVA21 at gritacademy.  
The project aims to create a portfolio of my work and competence.  
  
Strategy  
0. MOBILE FIRST!
1. Draw page layout. Pen and paper  
2. create first page html  
3. create first page css  
4. structure / restructure html and css coding design and convention  
5. Tänk på att crawler ska kunna hitta. filnamn, alt-taggar, nyckelord, headers  
Detta är vad man ser i sökresultatet:  
- title  
- meta name description content  
  
a rel nofollow om man länkar en lågrankad sida  
meta property open graph för sociala medier  
6. build rest of the pages  
  
  
QUESTIONS:
- How to align items inside a child? (eg a the text in the header)  
- My hover effects on the email symbol sucks  
- When using one CSS and many html, always use classes to separate items?  
- How to structure html code with semantic tags?  
- How to align mailsymbol in footer with pictures above? need to use more columns? 
- On mobile page for about the text and linkes overlaps
-
- How to include code in HTML? Eg, I do not want to have footer code on all html-pages, i just wanna point at the code
- How to make a fly-out menu for the mobile pages?
- How does sticky works? Cannot get it to work for my footer
- contact information on contact page enough?


-->RESULT<--
1. 
- Most fun with this project was that it is a something that can be used and maintained during my career
- The handledningsdagar was really good, both to get help and to hear about others problems, but also to set aside time.

2. Problems during project
- Include HTML code. Now I have footer and header code at each page. They use the same classes but the content is on the individual page
- Coding design, in this case how to structure the styles in one CSS

- It was a bit tricky to find the resize attribute for the contact page so that the textboxes resize with the window
- Estimate the time and effort needed in order to make such a simple website
- Finding, evaluating and understanding information

- Specification when you don't have any experience, hard to specify details

3. Next time
- Mobile first design due to best pratice
- Spend more time in specification (eg deside all basic functionality and design)
- Spend more time in getting rid of double coding instead of graphical details
- Design page layout better
- Coding reviews


-->PRESENTATION<--
- Overall wanted to have a pretty clean design, maybe it turned out a bit too clean :)
- Focused on turned out to be a website CV...
- Projects page was a bit messy, no distinct differentiation between header 

- Have a common wrapper, header, footer and nav for all pages

- All projects in flexbox

- In the header i kept my name and a nav that moves depending on resolution

- The footer i intentionally only had a contact icon

- The contact icon opens your mail client and so does the contact page since i didn't know how to do it in another way

- About me was just a picture of me and some personal links

- Projectpages:
--> 3 projects I've made, including this
--> 1 from work, 1 from another course
--> All projectpages same layout, a couple of pictures with some text and linkes to the relevants
--> On the mobile resolution the pictures are scrolled horizontally and nav is sticky
